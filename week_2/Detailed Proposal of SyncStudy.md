## Project Description

This should be a high-level overview of your project, suitable for a reader who isn't an expert in the topic area. This will be most useful for the second marker, who might have no prior knowledge of the project. Throughout the document you should aim to explain the project in sufficient detail that anyone reading it has a clear understanding of what you are doing, and why you're doing it. This section should be succinct, so aim for a few paragraphs. You can add more detail in the later sections.

## Aims & Objectives

The aims of your project are broad statements of intent. In other words, what you expect to have achieved after completing the work. For example, *Create a platform that allows users to design their own board games*. Objectives are more measurable and include the steps needed to achieve the aims. For example, *Implement a game description language that encodes the rules for board games*.

There will usually be more objectives than aims. The difference between aims and objectives is not always easy to grasp, but objectives should be things that you can test. In the given example, the testing plan would ensure the game description language is robust and works properly. Your aims and objectives should be presented as bullet points to help readability.

## Key Literature & Background Reading

You should demonstrate a good knowledge of the topic area. During the first few weeks of the project you will be conducting background reading and looking at various sources of information. Some will be technical (such as API documentation) and some will cover previous research in the area, or simply provide further details that are useful to you.

In this section you should describe the background to your project, citing and summarising key literature. This should not simply be a list of references (that section comes at the end). It should be more of a discussion of any related work and technical documentation that will be useful to you. Aim for around 1000 words in this section.

## Development Process & Method

Provide a brief overview of your development method. For example, are you following the traditional waterfall model or taking a more modern rapid prototyping approach? Explain which programming languages and environments you will be using, and how they will be integrated into your workflow. Will you be using version control (such as GitHub) or some other system of keeping backups? Bear in mind the risks of losing your work due to system failures (covered in a separate section). Each project is different, so you might have little or lots to explain here.

## Data Sources

If you are using datasets from the public domain, accessing or processing publicly available text, or generating your own data as part of the project, mention it in this section. You should describe the data you will be using, state how it will be obtained, confirm you are using it with permission, and explain how you will ensure confidentiality of any personal information. If you're not using any data in your project then include a statement to that effect, but check with your supervisor that there is genuinely no data use. Remember that evaluation questionnaires will generate data.

## Testing & Evaluation

Explain how you will test and evaluate your software. At this stage you don't have to include a detailed testing plan, since you probably don't know exactly what components will be produced or how they will work together. However, you should at least have a high-level idea of the type of testing you will carry out. If you intend to use other people as beta testers, including the use of evaluation questionnaires, you should confirm that this will be done ethically (see the next section).

## Ethical Considerations

In this section you should mention anything that might require you to act ethically. You should state that you have read our [ethical guidelines](https://student.csc.liv.ac.uk/internal/modules/comp390/2020-21/ethics.php) and will follow them. This will include the use of data in the public domain, the generation of new data, and the results of testing and evaluation. There could be other ethical considerations that are specific to your project. If so, discuss them with your supervisor and explain them briefly here.

## BCS Project Criteria

Your degree programme is accredited by [BCS](https://www.bcs.org/), the Chartered Institute for IT. They require honours year projects to demonstrate the following six outcomes.

- An ability to apply practical and analytical skills gained during the degree programme.
- Innovation and/or creativity.
- Synthesis of information, ideas and practices to provide a quality solution together with an evaluation of that solution.
- That your project meets a real need in a wider context.
- An ability to self-manage a significant piece of work.
- Critical self-evaluation of the process.

In this section you should explain how your project deliverables and development method will meet these criteria. Some of these might be covered in other sections of the document, so refer to them if necessary.



## Software & Hardware Resources

State the software and hardware resources required for your project. This will likely include your own laptop or PC, perhaps a mobile device, cloud computing platforms, and university systems. If you are developing your project using software that is not provided by the university, state that you have a valid licence to use it. If you are using your own hardware or external services, you should consider the risks of failure or downtime (there is a separate section for risks and contingencies). Note that you are responsible for all costs associated with the development of your project.

## Project Plan

Include a Gantt chart (or similar project plan) with enough detail to show each stage of your project and your estimates for their duration. Show aspects that can overlap, activities that have dependencies, and so on. Remember to include time for presenting the project and writing the dissertation.

## Risks & Contingency Plans

This section should be presented as a table with four columns: Risks, Contingencies, Likelihood and Impact. Common risks for all projects include hardware failure, software failure, running out of time, and programming problems. List possible risks in the first column, and your plans for preventing or handling them in the second column. The third column should state how likely you think the risk is (low, medium or high) and the final column should state the impact. Sometimes things with very low likelihood, such as losing your backups, could have a very high impact on the project.

## References

List references to articles, websites, videos, datasets, journals, and any other background reading you carried out while writing the document and planning your project. References should be cited properly in the main body of the document. You should use the [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthetical_referencing) or [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_style) referencing style. Guidance is available on the [university library website](https://libguides.liverpool.ac.uk/referencing/).
